# Vision-based-Math-Solver-using-OpenCv-and-Generative-AI
A virtual calculator powered by OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Generative AI, enabling users to solve complex math problems by drawing equations on-screen using hand gestures. The system captures the visual input, processes it via Google's Gemini LLM API key, and displays a detailed solution in real time.
